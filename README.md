## WeekOne Web502 


For the first week of Web502, we had our introduction to our class this semester. We had a look at the outline and created our repository for our work. We had a look at git pages and the cheat sheets of all the commands to make our markdowns more presentable. We also added themes to our pages. As an activity we created a table with all our assessments weightings and due dates, just to get us a bit familiar with using git markdown commands.



Assessments  | Weighting %  |  Due date
------------ | ------------- | ---------------
Assessment 1: Labs | 25% | Week 1-8
Assessment 2: Knowledge Quiz | 25% | Week 14
Assessment 3: Implement a framework solution | 50% | week 15
